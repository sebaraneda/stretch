## Clamshell

Hip abductor and external rotation strengthening exercise

### Description

Loop a miniband or tie an exercise band around the thighs just above the knees. Sit down on a chair or bench with your knees bent to 90 degrees and feet planted together. Spread the band apart by pushing out with your knees and hold for up to 2 seconds before bringing the knees together again.

You can lay on your side with your knees bent, and you lift the top knee up as far as you can without rotating the hips back, and then return to the starting position. Banded clamshells simply add resistance by placing a band just above the knee for the duration of the exercise.

Side plank clamshell (master this move without band first, then add a resistance band to increase the difficulty).

1. Lay on your side on the mat in the same setup position as the clamshell, except your bottom elbow will be underneath your shoulder.

2. Pop up into a side plank, with the hips pressed forward so that your shoulder, hips, and knees are in a straight line.

3. Lift the top knee slowly to perform the clamshell movement, and slowly lower it back down to the starting position.
