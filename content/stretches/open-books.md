Lie down on your side with the leg overtop supported by a pillow or foam roller. 

Keeping both arms straight in front of you, lift your top arm up towards the ceiling then behind your back while rotating through your spine. 

Complete the movement without letting your leg come off of the pillow / foam roller. Slowly return to start to complete a single repetition.
