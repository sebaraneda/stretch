## Hip Switches

Hip internal and external rotation mobility exercise.

### Description

Sit on the ground with your knees bent in front of you wider than shoulder distance apart. Rotate one leg into internal rotation and the other into external rotation. Your thighs should be 90 degrees to each other, you can reposition the body to achieve this if needed.

Additionally, to make it easier, lean back and place your hands on the ground behind you for support. Gradually work your way up to having your hands off the ground.
